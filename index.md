# About us

![[pleiad logo branco urania estrelado Medium.png]]

Our name comes from PopuLações Estelares IntegrADas, which means Integrated Stellar Populations.  We use the light of stars to understand the evolution of galaxies.

# What do we work on?

What we see in galaxies is mostly the light of stars. Many stars, with different properties. We need large collections of stars. We need [[Stellar Spectral Libraries]].

The mixtures of stars are not random. They obey the laws of stellar and chemical evolution. We know how to combine the stars into meaningful stellar populations with [[Stellar Population Models]].

The simpler (though not simple) cases of stellar populations are [[Stellar Clusters]].
Since all stars form in clusters, in a sense one can think of galaxies as a mixture of stellar clusters.

We can compare our simulated data (the Stellar Population Models) with observed data (real clusters and galaxies) to look into other galaxies with [[Extragalactic Archaeology]]. Like archaeologists, we use fossil records -- the light of living stars -- to understand the past.
