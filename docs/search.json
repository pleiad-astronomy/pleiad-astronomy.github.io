    "text": "Our name comes from PopuLações Estelares IntegrADas, which means Integrated Stellar Populations. We use the light of stars to understand the evolution of galaxies.\nWhat we see in galaxies is mostly the light of stars. Many stars, with different properties. We need large collections of stars. We need Stellar Spectral Libraries.\nThe mixtures of stars are not random. They obey the laws of stellar and chemical evolution. We know how to combine the stars into meaningful stellar populations with Stellar Population Models.\nThe simpler (though not simple) cases of stellar populations are Stellar Clusters. Since all stars form in clusters, in a sense one can think of galaxies as a mixture of stellar clusters.\nWe can compare our simulated data (the Stellar Population Models) with observed data (real clusters and galaxies) to look into other galaxies with Extragalactic Archaeology. Like archaeologists, we use fossil records – the light of living stars – to understand the past."
